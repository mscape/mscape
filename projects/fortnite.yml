description: Fortnite is an online free-to-play battle royale video game in
  which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing. Weaponless
  players airdrop from a "Battle Bus" that crosses the game's map. When they
  land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles
  while trying to stay alive and to attack and eliminate other players. Over the
  course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an
  incoming toxic storm.
