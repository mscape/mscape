description: Minecraft is a sandbox video game where players explore a blocky,
  procedurally generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain, and may
  discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build
  structures, earthworks and simple machines. Depending on game mode, players
  can fight computer-controlled mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete
  against other players in the same world.
